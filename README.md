# api
API that powers www.hotsdata.com

# How to install
> npm install

# How to run
> node server.js

# What are the most important files?
- server.js where the routes are defined
- route_functions.js where the logic for each route is implemented
- queries.js where the queries to retrieve data from PosgresSQL are. The DB schema is available [here](https://github.com/hotsdata/hots-parser/blob/master/database/database_schema.sql)

# Note
We learnt node along the way, so this has a lot of room for improvement ;)
