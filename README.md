API that powers www.hotsdata.com

# How to install

# What are the most important files?
- server.js where the routes are defined
- route_functions.js where the logic for each route is implemented
- queries.js where the queries to retrieve data from PosgresSQL are.

# Note
We learnt node along the way, so this has a lot of room for improvement ;)
